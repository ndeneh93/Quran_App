MGQS Node.js Assessment
Task
Using Node.js, create a Qur’an reading web application. The source data can be any public Qur’an API (e.g., quran.com).
Requirements
The application should have three pages:
1. Chapters List
2. Single Chapter
3. Bookmarks
Chapters List
This page should be a list of all 114 chapters. Clicking on any chapter from this list should lead the user to ‘Single Chapter’ page.
Single Chapters
This page should show all the verses for the selected chapter. The verses should be readable. There should be an option against each verse to bookmark the verse. An option to remove bookmark should be there for verses that have already been bookmarked.
Note:
• The IP addresses of users can be used as the unique identifier.
• You can ignore the fact that IP addresses may not be static, and that multiple people can be accessing the application from the same IP address.
Bookmarks
This page should show all verses which have been bookmarked by the current IP address.
